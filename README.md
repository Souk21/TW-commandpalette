# TW-commandpalette
A command palette for TiddlyWiki

[Demo Page](https://souk21.github.io/TW-commandpalette/)

Please backup your wiki before installing this plugin

### Ideas:
- Modularize (Core plugin contains only basic commands (or none?) sub-plugins add different types of commands)
- Create commands for all features from 'Tools' tab (import,...)
- Profiles (Different search order, hide/show commands/modules, switchable with command/shorcut)
- Theming
- Server module (messaging server, tiddlywiki node.js commands)
- Pipe/chain commands, BulkActions (Apply a command to a filter operation, e.g add field for all tiddler tagged with)
- Filter operation history (with tiddler history? or when input is `[` ?)
- Context in results ?
- Highlight match in results ?
- `X` button at the right of opened tiddlers ?
- Show shortcuts of commands ?
- Show nb of occurrences when searching tags
- Insert result in previously focused element
- Search/list `content-type`
- Search in page?
- Show colors in filter results
- Show backlinks/freelinks
- Open multiple tiddlers with right arrow ?
- Open tiddler in edit mode?
